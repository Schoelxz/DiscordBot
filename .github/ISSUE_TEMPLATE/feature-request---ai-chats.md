The bot will read messages from users and maybe reply to the users message. Could be very non-complicated responds and reads. Try making it so the bot won't respond with the same words, and not to respond every time it recognize a message it could respond to.

Maybe implement some machine learning?
Log replies and messages to control behavior and maybe learning?
Quote-dump?
